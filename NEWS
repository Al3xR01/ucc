- UCC API to support library, contexts, teams, collective operations, execution
  engine, memory types, and triggered operations

#### Core
- Added implementation for UCC abstractions - library, contexts, team,
  collective operations, execution engine, memory types, and triggered
  operations

  CPU or device (GPU) 
- Added support for UCC_THREAD_MULTIPLE_MODE
- Added support for CUDA stream-based collectives 


#### TL
